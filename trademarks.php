            <p class="text-block">Don't be fooled into thinking that the registration of a business,company or domain
                name will allow you to use that name to the exclusion of others. Only a trademark can allow you to do so.</p>
            <p class="text-block">A trademark, once registered, will give you the exclusive right to use, license or
                sell the mark for the goods and services for which it is registered.</p>
            <p class="text-block">While it is not compulsory to register a trademark, registration provides an easier
                and more cost efficient way to enforce the rights conferred by a trademark and may prevent third parties
                or competitors from using your mark on the same, or even related, goods or services.</p>

                    Trademarks need to be filed in one or more of 45 classes of products or services. We can advise you
                    which classes are appropriate and we will also provide a suitable description for your goods and
                    services if you choose to engage our services.

                <p class="story-text">
                    Generally, the first step is to conduct a trademark search to see if your mark has been registered as a
                    trademark by someone else. If itâ€™s given the all clear, then we can proceed with filing the trademark
                    application.

                <p  class="story-text">
                    Once filed, a trademark undergoes examination at IP Australia (the Australian Trademarks office) and
                    if all a goes well, it is accepted. After acceptance there is 2-month "opposition" period during
                    which third parties can object to or oppose your trademark, but this does not happen regularly. The
                    trademark is registered following the two-month opposition period.

                <p  class="story-text">
                    If the trademark examination process highlights prior marks that the trademark examiner thinks is
                    relevant then we will work with you in coming up with arguments to overcome these objections as far
                    as possible. This is usually done at extra cost but happens quite seldom because we do very thorough
                    trademark searches.
