                    <p class="text-block">A patent is a right that a government provides to an inventor who has come up with an original technical
                        invention. Most countries have this system, although the requirements differ slightly from country to
                        country. Once a patent right has been approved by the government, it will allow you to stop other people
                        or companies from copying your idea.</p>
                    <p class="text-block">If your invention meets the general requirements then a patent can usually be granted for the invention
                        in most countries once it has undergone some form of examination by that country's Patent Office.</p>

                            <p>Most countries have a so-called “absolute” novelty requirement, which implies that any
                                disclosure anywhere in the world before filing your patent application will destroy the
                                novelty of your invention, thereby also destroying or curtailing your patent rights.</p>
                            <p>An inventor may sometimes unwittingly destroy the novelty of his/her own invention by
                                disclosing it prior to filing a patent application. You must keep it secret until you

                                disclosed to the public in patent specifications or other literature or disclosures.
                                All such disclosures are known as “prior art”. </p>
                            <p>The test for inventiveness under our patent law is to conjecture whether someone skilled
                                in the field of the invention (called a person “skilled in the art”) would consider your
                                invention to be obvious or not – it follows that an invention that is obvious to a person
                                skilled in the art is not considered inventive. </p>
                            <p>This test is by its very nature highly subjective, and therefore the decision to file a
                                patent application is often dictated more by business strategy than by considerations of
                                the inventiveness of the invention. We can help you with this decision, based on our
                                experience of filing patent applications all over the world.</p>

                                protected by way of a patent, if it also meets the novelty and inventiveness

                    and we are one of very few patent firms in the country that quotes a fixed price for getting your idea

            <p class="text-block">No search is fully exhaustive or conclusive, so for this reason it is important to include as much
                information as possible in the provisional patent application, so that you have as many fail-back
                positions as possible, if it turns out that certain aspects of your invention have been done before.
                For this reason, we believe in writing your patent document to global best practice quality levels.</p>
            <p class="text-block">Once we’re done with it, your provisional patent application can serve as the basis for patent
                applications in nearly every country of the world. We usually charge upwardly of $3500 for patent
