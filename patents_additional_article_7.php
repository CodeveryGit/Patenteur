            As a patent law practice, we can’t provide commercial advice but we can certainly tell what we’ve seen has
            worked and what hasn’t worked based on experience gained from working with other clients and the patenting
            process. Basically, after you’ve filed your provisional patent application, done your market research and
            determined that a market exists for your invention, you should consider creating a prototype and conducting
            testing. </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            A prototype is a model of your invention that puts all of the things you have written in your provisional
            patent application into practice and can be used to woo funders, manufacturers, or distributors.</p>
        <p class="text-header-block">Why should you create a prototype?</p>
        <p class="text-block">
            Although there is no prerequisite that patentees have to build a prototype of their invention, the most
            obvious reason for creating a prototype is to have something tangible to present to potential investors and
            buyers. </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            Prototypes demonstrate the functionality of your invention and help you to discover more patentable details
            of your invention before you file your complete patent application. In general, at this early stage try to
            prototype as cheaply as possible. Stephen Key’s excellent ‘One Simple Idea’ contains a fantastic section on
            cheap and rapid prototyping. </p>
        <p class="text-block">
            In general, most interested parties that you approach won’t need a prototype that they can touch or interact
            with. Having a physical prototype is obviously first prize, but it’s amazing how far you can go with 3D
            renderings, videos, and photos.</p>
        <p class="text-header-block">How to prototype cheaply and easily</p>
        <p class="text-block">These days, you can use simple (and free!) programs such as Google’s ‘Sketch-up’ to very
            easily and quickly render a 3D model of your idea that you can show to interested parties in a presentation.
            This program is very easy to use and you could get a decent prototype drawing done within a morning. </p>
        <p class="text-block">You can also build a cardboard mockup of your idea and take photos of it. From most angles
            most people won’t even be able to tell that it’s made of cardboard if you play around with materials and
            lighting conditions. </p>
        <p class="text-block">Better yet, create a video of it and load it to an online player with a confidentiality
            setting. YouTube, for example, has a setting which keeps the video private and which allows you to control
            access to it by way of links and/or passwords. This can save you an enormous amount of money and still get
            the same results (or nearly the same results) than you would have if you had engaged the services of a
            prototype or industrial design company. </p>
        <p class="text-block">As mentioned before, it is important that you ensure that you own the rights to the design,
            so that you are in fact the IP owner. Have a look at the IP assignment agreement that I’ve included in your
            workbook – you’ll see that it specifically says that the rights associated with any design are assigned to
            you or your company, whichever you prefer. Keep in mind that a complete patent application protects the
            ‘perfected’ form of the invention.</p>
        <p class="text-block">As you proceed along the road of developing your invention, you will almost always
            discover a flaw in your original design or think of a new feature you would like to add. If you obtain
            final/complete patent protection for your idea before you work out these snags, it will be too late to
            include them in the patent and you will risk losing the patent rights of the new or improved design to
            someone else. </p>
        <p class="text-block">You should try to get a prototype made in a way that creates a version of your product
            that matches your final product as closely as possible, but in a small quantity. There are two major
            advantages to having multiple ‘product quality’ prototypes: You can have multiple people looking at them
            and not worry much if one gets broken or is not returned, and you can put some on the market for sale for
            real and see what actually happens when buyers have the opportunity to purchase them. </p>
        <p class="text-block">Obtaining actual proof that the product will sell before you spend the large amounts of
            money often required for production tooling will substantially reduce the risk of you losing that money. Of
            course, make sure that the version that you’re putting on the market is protected with at least a provisional
            patent application and/or a design registration application (whichever is most appropriate, or both).</p>

        <p class="text-header-block">Who can help me create a prototype of my invention?</p>
        <p class="text-block">When you’re looking for a prototyper, you should go about it in much the same way as
            looking for a manufacturer: network with similar professionals, look on the Internet or in relevant
            publications, or search under headings like ‘designers, industrial’ and ‘engineer, product development’. </p>
        <p class="text-block">Before you contact a prototyper, you should have a clear picture of exactly what you
            need. Never approach a prototyper with rough sketches or a vague verbal description. Get a draftsperson
            to draft technical drawings of your invention. They don’t have to be intricately detailed, but they
            should include all essential dimensions and details required for the prototype to be constructed.
            Remember – it’s far less costly to change a design mistake on paper than it is to try to modify something
            that’s already in metal or plastic. </p>
        <p class="text-block">As mentioned before: If you hire a drafting, design or engineering firm to help create
            your product, you can very well end up with a co-inventor. If that engineer is required to do any real
            engineering and they come up with patentable matter, they must be cited as inventors in the patent application.
            To prevent that person from owning the invention along with you, you need an invention assignment agreement in
            conjunction with the actual consulting contract. The agreement specifies that you are commissioning the person
            to assist you, but that any patentable matter that comes out of this relationship will be assigned to you.</p>
        <p class="text-block">You still need to name the engineer or prototyper on your patent as an inventor, but if you
            have the agreement completed before you file, then that person has no rights to your patent. It may seem like
            a minor formality, but if you neglect to do it, the engineer could have equal rights to your invention.</p>
        <p class="text-block">Once you have created a prototype, you should conduct prototype testing. Make sure the
            product does what people want and performs well enough for people to buy it.Also, be sure your product has
            all the features end-users want. Let them try out the product, and gauge their responses. If at all possible,
            you should consider making a prototype for both mechanical testing and for market research. Do this no matter
            how sure you are that the product will sell. </p>
        <p class="text-block">Most inventions must go through three or four prototypes before they are perfected from both
            a manufacturing and a marketing point of view. In the long run, making those prototypes saves you lots of money
            and allows you to produce the best possible product.   Filed Under: intellectual property, IP, patent, patent
