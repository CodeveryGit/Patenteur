        <p class="text-block">If you have come up with an item that has a new shape, then you can apply for esign
            registration to protect the look of that item.</p>
        <p class="text-block">Design registrations (called "Design Patents" in the USA) don't protect the functional
            aspects of a new shape or configuration; rather, they protect the aesthetic appearance of a design as
            applied to an item.</p>
        <p class="text-block">A design thus refers to the features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation
            that give a product a unique appearance. A registered design gives you the owner, exclusive rights to
            commercially use it, licence or sell it.

        <p class="text-header-block">What is a Registered Design?</p>
        <p class="text-block">A registered industrial design is used to protect the "look" of a particular item. As
            such, a registered design protects the appearance of an article, unlike a patent which protects the
            underlying invention on which an article is based.</p>
        <p class="text-block">Design registration is intended to protect designs which have an industrial or commercial
            use. Australia, the initial term of a Registered Design is 5 years, and this can be extended by

        <p class="text-header-block">Can I Register My Design?</p>
        <p class="text-block">To be registrable (i.e. eligible for protection), your design must be "new" and
            "distinctive". This means that you should have originated it and not copied it from somewhere else. In
            other words:.</p>
        <p class="text-block indent">-<span class="text-bold">New</span>: it must not be identical to any design previously
            disclosed anywhere in the world (including on the internet), nor any design previously used in Australia;</p>
        <p class="text-block indent">-<span class="text-bold">Distinctive</span>: it must not be substantially similar in
            overall impression to any design previously published anywhere in the world (including on the internet),
            nor any design previously used in Australia.</p>
        <p class="text-block">Design Classification Designs are grouped into different classes of technology and a
            design application may be filed in one or more classes, to provide protection against infringing products
            falling in the same class.</p>
        <p class="text-block">It is important to note that the protection is limited to articles falling in the same
            class for which the design has been registered. The classes into which designs are classified are set out
            at the end of this page. You can't get designs protection for:</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- Medals</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- layouts for an integrated circuit</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- the Olympic rings symbol, the Olympic motto or the torch and flames design,
            prescribed under the Olympic Insignia Protection Act</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- the word Anzac</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- information or graphics which might reasonably be regarded as scandalous</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- coins or notes of a kind prohibited by subsection 19(1) of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981</p>
        <p class="text-block indent italic">- the coat of arms, flags or seal of the Commonwealth or any state of the Commonwealth</p>

        <p class="text-block">It's always best to conduct a designs search first before spending money on filing a

        <p class="text-block">It is possible to do your own designs search. For Australian innovators, you can use the
            IP Australia designs database called ADDS, and which contains pictures and details of designs filed in
            Australia. This is free, so have a look.</p>
