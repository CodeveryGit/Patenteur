        <p class="text-block">Patents are time and date sensitive. You have 12 months in which to file a complete patent
            application based on your provisional patent application. If you'd like to file a complete patent application,
            it is important that you contact us within 10 months or so of filing your provisional patent application in
            order to give us sufficient time to draft and prepare a complete patent application for your invention.</p>
        <p class="text-block">As mentioned above, failure to file a patent application or patent applications within the
            set deadlines may result in your patent rights being forfeited. You may claim patent priority in a foreign
            patent application from an Australian provisional patent application, but only within 12 months from the
            date of filing the provisional patent application.</p>

        <p class="text-header-block">The importance of dates in the patent process</p>
        <p class="text-block">We file patents all over the world for our clients. Nearly every country in the world has
            a patent system and you need to file your patent and get it granted in each country that you want to protect
            your idea in.</p>
        <p class="text-block">There is no such thing as a global "patent". This would imply that you simply file a
            single application somewhere and it magically gets granted in every country of the world. Unfortunately,
            there isn't this level of hegemony in international trade yet, although it is coming closer.</p>
        <p class="text-block">Rather, you have the opportunity of filing what's called an "International" patent
            application. This is only an application. It does not result in the granting/finalisation of an international
            patent. It is merely a delay line which buys you 18 (very valuable) months at the beginning of your
            patentjourney to help you spread outyour patent costs over a much longer time than if you had to file
            patents in each country on day one. It is used by most companies and individuals in the world when they
            want to file in 2 or more foreign countries, as it gives you a very handy search report to show you what
            has gone before and whether your patent is still new and inventive.</p>
        <p class="text-block">Speak to us about the filing of a PCT application (Patent Cooperation Treaty) - this is
            another name for an international patent application. For country entries, through our network of foreign
            patent agents we can file foreign patent applications in your countries of interest, most likely cheaper
            than if you were to do so yourself. As a few countries are not members of certain international patent
            treaties, we would ask you please to let us know at the time of filing your provisional patent application
            in which countries you are considering</p>
